## Image processor

   `cargo run infile.png outfile.png blur 2.5 invert rotate 180 brighten 10`  

 ...then your program would:
 - read infile.png
 - apply a blur of 2.5
 - invert the colors
 - rotate the image 180 degrees clockwise
 - brighten the image by 10
 - and write the result to outfile.png
